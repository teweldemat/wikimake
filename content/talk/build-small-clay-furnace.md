## Purpose

Discussion for refining furnace geometry, clay recipe, and drying/firing protocol.

## Open questions

- What bore/height ratio gives the best beginner reliability for copper smelting?
- Should we document a no-tuyere natural-draft variant as a baseline?

## Proposed improvements

- Add a second diagram with typical crack locations and patching method.
- Add a table of clay:sand:fiber mixes by local soil behavior.

## Decisions

- None yet.
