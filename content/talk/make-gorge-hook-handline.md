## Purpose

Discussion for improving the gorge hook + handline article (better knots, fish behavior notes, and region-neutral material choices).

## Open questions

- What is the best simple lashing/knot description that works for beginners without naming knots?
- Which bait recommendations are most universal (worms/insects) without assuming access to other tools?

## Proposed improvements

- Add a “fish size” table: gorge size vs line thickness vs bait size.
- Add a short “where to fish” section that focuses on water movement and cover, not species.

## Decisions

- None yet.
