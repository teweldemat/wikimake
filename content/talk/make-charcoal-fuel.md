## Purpose

Discussion for improving charcoal production yield, consistency, and safety guidance.

## Open questions

- Should we standardize a target wood moisture range using field tests?
- What is the clearest “smoke color timeline” for beginners?

## Proposed improvements

- Add an SVG of pit layout + vent management stages.
- Add a small yield tracking table (input wood volume vs charcoal output).

## Decisions

- None yet.
