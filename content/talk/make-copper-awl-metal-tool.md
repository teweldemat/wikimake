## Purpose

Discussion for improving billet consolidation, forging sequence, and tool durability.

## Open questions

- Should we include a simple quality test for work-hardening at the tip?
- What handle designs are most robust without advanced adhesives?

## Proposed improvements

- Add comparative variants: unhafted awl vs split-handle lashing.
- Add a repair workflow for bent or blunted tips.

## Decisions

- None yet.
