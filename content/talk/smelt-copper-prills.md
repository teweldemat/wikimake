## Purpose

Discussion for improving smelt repeatability, charge schedule, and prill recovery.

## Open questions

- What ore-to-charcoal ratio gives best beginner recovery in small furnaces?
- Should we add a dedicated slag re-smelt workflow as a separate article?

## Proposed improvements

- Add a run log template (charge timing, airflow, observed heat zones, yield).
- Add photos/diagrams of typical slag vs metal-bearing slag.

## Decisions

- None yet.
