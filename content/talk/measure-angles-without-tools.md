## Purpose

Discussion for improving the angle-measurement reference article (clear constructions, minimal required tools).

## Open questions

- Should we standardize on a single “reference set” (90/60/45/30) across the repo?
- Is the 3-4-5 construction explained clearly enough without diagrams?

## Proposed improvements

- Add an SVG showing the 3-4-5 triangle and the bisection steps (arrows + points).
- Add a short section for “estimating” angles when you cannot draw arcs cleanly (use 60° and 90° references).

## Decisions

- None yet.
