## Purpose

Discussion for improving cordage instructions (fiber selection by region, strength tests, and better splicing techniques).

## Open questions

- What are the best “observable” identifiers for good fiber plants without relying on species names?
- What is the simplest strength test we can standardize (pull test, lift test, abrasion test)?

## Proposed improvements

- Add an SVG showing the reverse-wrap motion (twist direction and wrap direction).
- Add a small table comparing fibers by properties (length, stiffness, abrasion resistance, water resistance).

## Decisions

- None yet.
