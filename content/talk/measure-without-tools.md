## Purpose

Discussion for improving the “Measure Without Tools” article (clarity, unit definitions, and how we keep Level 0 consistent).

## Open questions

- Which units should we standardize on across Wikimake (finger width, palm width, handspan, cubit, pace)?
- Should we publish a single “Wikimake recommended unit set”, or let each article choose?

## Proposed improvements

- Add a small SVG showing the units (handspan, cubit, pace) as silhouettes or simple arrows (no humans).
- Add examples embedded in 2 to 3 early articles that use the units consistently.

## Decisions

- None yet.
