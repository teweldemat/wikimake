## Purpose

This page is for discussion about improving the article and recording decisions.

## Open questions

- What are the best low-tech wood pairings by biome/region (and how do we describe them without assuming species knowledge)?
- What minimum “verification” signals are most reliable for beginners?

## Proposed improvements

- Add an SVG diagram showing hearth/notch/dust pan and body positioning.
- Add a short troubleshooting flowchart (dust color, squeak, glazing, tinder failure).
- Clarify the “no cutting tool” path (this sentence: `If you have no cutting tool, you can grind/scrape with a sharp stone...`): decide whether “sharp stone” is treated as a natural object (and add enough instructions to find/select one), or an artificial tool (and link to a Level 0 article for making a stone scraper/flake edge).
- Replace cm-only measurements with Level 0-friendly approximations (finger width, handspan, arm length) and optionally add cm in parentheses for modern readers; consider a Level 0 “measurement without tools” reference article.

## Decisions

- None yet.
