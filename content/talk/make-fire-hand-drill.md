## Purpose

This page is for discussion about improving the article and recording decisions.

## Open questions

- What are the best low-tech wood pairings by biome/region (and how do we describe them without assuming species knowledge)?
- What minimum “verification” signals are most reliable for beginners?

## Proposed improvements

- [x] Add an SVG diagram showing hearth/notch/dust pan and body positioning (added: `/diagrams/hand-drill-fire-setup.svg`).
- [x] Clarify the “no cutting tool” path by treating “sharp stone edge” as a natural object by default and adding selection/usage guidance in the article.
- [x] Replace cm-only measurements with Level 0-friendly approximations (cm kept in parentheses for modern readers).
- [x] Add a short troubleshooting flowchart/decision tree (implemented as text in the article).

## Decisions

- “Sharp stone edge” is treated as a natural-world input by default; optional future improvement is a separate Level 0 article for making a reliable stone flake/scraper when naturally sharp edges are scarce.
- Measurements should be body-first (handspan, thumb thickness, arm-length) with metric in parentheses for modern readers.
