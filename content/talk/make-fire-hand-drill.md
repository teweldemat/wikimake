## Purpose

This page is for discussion about improving the article and recording decisions.

## Open questions

- What are the best low-tech wood pairings by biome/region (and how do we describe them without assuming species knowledge)?
- What minimum “verification” signals are most reliable for beginners?

## Proposed improvements

- Add an SVG diagram showing hearth/notch/dust pan and body positioning.
- Add a short troubleshooting flowchart (dust color, squeak, glazing, tinder failure).

## Decisions

- None yet.
