## Purpose

Discussion for improving stone flake instructions (material selection, safe technique, and validation).

## Open questions

- How do we describe “good knapping rock” without using geology terms readers may not know?
- Should we add a minimal “blade handling” section (wrapping, safe grips) as its own Level 0 article?

## Proposed improvements

- Add an SVG showing strike angle and where to hit the core (arrows + simple shapes).
- Add a short “field test” checklist for rock selection (nail catch, fracture surface, durability).

## Decisions

- None yet.
