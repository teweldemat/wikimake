## Next

- [ ] Add a small “materials selection” table with observable properties (hardness, resin, grain) not species names.
- [ ] Add a wind/moisture mitigation subsection (how to keep tinder dry while drilling).

## Done

- [x] Initial article draft exists.
- [x] Add an SVG diagram (and any PNG render must be generated from the SVG source).
- [x] Clarify the “no cutting tool” path (Level 0 method).
- [x] Replace cm-only measurements with Level 0-friendly approximations (cm kept in parentheses for modern readers).
- [x] Add a troubleshooting decision tree.
