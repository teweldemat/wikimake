## Next

- [ ] Add an SVG diagram (and any PNG render must be generated from the SVG source).
- [ ] Add a small “materials selection” table with observable properties (hardness, resin, grain) not species names.
- [ ] Add a wind/moisture mitigation subsection (how to keep tinder dry while drilling).

## Done

- [x] Initial article draft exists.
