## Summary

Charcoal is wood that has been heated with limited oxygen. It burns hotter and cleaner than raw wood, which makes it a core fuel for early metalwork.

This article describes a simple pit method that can be done with Level 0 tools.

## Prerequisites

- Fire source: [Make Fire (Hand Drill)](/articles/make-fire-hand-drill)

## Materials

- Dry wood (thumb-thick to wrist-thick pieces work well)
- Bare soil area
- Optional: green leaves/grass to limit oxygen when covering
- Dirt/sand for sealing
- Sticks for handling hot material

## Steps

### 1) Prepare a charcoal pit

1. Dig a shallow pit about 1 to 2 handspans deep and several handspans wide.
2. Keep loose soil nearby for covering.
3. Choose a wind-sheltered location away from dry grass.

### 2) Stack wood tightly

1. Place larger pieces at the bottom.
2. Fill gaps with smaller pieces so the pile is dense.
3. Leave a small top area where you can start the fire.

Dense stacking reduces extra oxygen pockets and improves yield.

### 3) Start a top burn

1. Light tinder/kindling at the top.
2. Allow the upper layer to burn strongly until lower pieces begin charring.
3. Watch smoke and flame: at first smoke is thick and white.

### 4) Limit oxygen and continue charring

1. Partly cover the pile with thin soil (or leaves first, then soil), leaving a few small vents.
2. Keep a slow, controlled burn by opening/closing vents as needed.
3. If flames burst through many places, add more cover.

Goal: wood should char, not burn to ash.

### 5) Finish and cool

1. When smoke thins and turns lighter blue, most volatiles are gone.
2. Seal all vents with soil.
3. Let the pit cool fully (often overnight).
4. Open and collect charcoal. Keep it dry.

Do not open while hot with oxygen present, or charcoal can ignite again.

## Verification

Good charcoal pieces are:

- Black all the way through (not brown wood core)
- Light for their size
- Crisp/brittle with a ringing snap
- Burning hot with little flame and less smoke than raw wood

## Safety

- Charcoal making can spread fire through roots and dry litter. Clear down to bare soil.
- Carbon monoxide is dangerous. Never do this in enclosed spaces.
- Hot charcoal can look “dead” but reignite with air.

## Troubleshooting

- **Mostly ash, low yield**: too much oxygen; cover earlier and seal better.
- **Brown wood inside pieces**: under-charred; extend burn time before final seal.
- **Pile keeps flaming after cover**: vents too large or cover too thin.

## Variants

- **Mound method**: stack wood above ground and cover with soil/turf.
- **Small-batch clamp**: for tiny amounts, char wood in a tightly covered clay vessel with a vent.
