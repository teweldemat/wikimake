## Summary

Not all green rocks are useful copper ore. This article shows how to identify promising candidates in the field and run a small high-heat test before committing to full smelting.

## Prerequisites

- Fire source: [Make Fire (Hand Drill)](/articles/make-fire-hand-drill)
- Breaking/crushing edge: [Make a Stone Flake Cutting Edge](/articles/make-stone-flake-cutting-edge)

## Materials

- Candidate rocks with green/blue mineral staining
- Hammerstone/anvil stone (natural rocks)
- Charcoal
- Small clay cup, depression, or thick charcoal bed
- Blowpipe (hollow reed/bone tube) or naturally strong draft from a narrow fire pit

## Where to search

- Oxidized zones in exposed rock (green/blue stains)
- Old stream cuts and gullies below mineralized outcrops
- Rubble at the base of weathered rock faces

## Steps

### 1) Collect candidates

1. Pick several rock samples with visible green/blue mineralization.
2. Prefer dense/heavy pieces over crumbly dirt-like pieces.
3. Keep samples separated and labeled by location.

### 2) Crush small samples

1. Break a small piece from each sample.
2. Crush to coarse grains (sand to pea size).
3. Remove obvious dirt and organic debris.

### 3) Run a charcoal reduction spot test

1. Make a small hot charcoal bed in a shallow pit or clay cup.
2. Mix crushed sample with fine charcoal dust (roughly equal handfuls).
3. Place mix in the hottest zone.
4. Keep strong heat/air blast for 15 to 30 minutes.

If using a blowpipe, direct air at the glowing mix in pulses to avoid scattering material.

### 4) Check the result

1. Let sample cool enough to handle safely.
2. Crush slaggy crust and inspect for metallic red/orange specks or beads.
3. Hammer a bead lightly on stone:
   - If it flattens without crumbling, it is likely copper metal.

## Verification

Promising ore typically gives:

- Metallic copper-colored specks/beads in test residue
- Beads that flatten under hammering rather than shatter

If all residue is brittle black/green slag with no malleable metal, ore grade may be low or test heat/reduction was insufficient.

## Safety

- Some ores may contain harmful elements (including arsenic). Avoid breathing dust/fumes.
- Crush and test outdoors with wind carrying fumes away from you.
- Keep food/water away from ore dust.

## Troubleshooting

- **No metallic beads**: increase temperature, use more charcoal relative to ore, crush ore finer.
- **Only tiny beads**: ore may still be viable; combine many test batches.
- **Material blows out of fire**: gentler air pulses, deeper hot pocket, or partial cover.

## Variants

- **Roast-before-test**: preheat ore in open air to drive off moisture/volatiles, then run reduction test.
- **Washed concentrate**: if ore is mixed with clay/mud, wash and settle heavier grains before testing.
