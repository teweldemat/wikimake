## Summary

An **angle** is a turn between two directions. Modern tools measure angles in **degrees**:

- A full turn is **360°**
- A half turn is **180°**
- A right angle is **90°**

At low tech, you usually do not need “exact” degrees. What you *do* need is a way to reproduce a few **reference angles** reliably (90°, 60°, 45°, 30°) and describe other angles as “between” those references.

## Prerequisites

- None (Level 0).

## Tools and materials (natural / Level 0)

- A straight stick (for a straightedge)
- A pointed stick or sharp stone edge (to scratch lines)
- Flat ground, sand, clay, or a flat board/stone surface you can mark

Optional but helpful:

- A flexible strip (bark strip, fiber strand) to use as a “compass” radius

## Reference angles and how to make them

### 90° (right angle): 3-4-5 triangle

This makes a right angle using only lengths.

1. Mark a point **A** on the ground.
2. From A, mark a point **B** at **4 handspans** (or any consistent unit).
3. From A in a different direction, mark a point **C** at **3 handspans**.
4. Move point C until the distance **BC** is exactly **5 handspans**.
5. Draw lines **AB** and **AC**. The angle at **A** is **90°**.

Any scaled version works (3-4-5, 6-8-10, 9-12-15). Use whatever size is easiest to measure.

### 60° (and 120°): equilateral triangle

1. Draw a baseline **AB** (any length you choose).
2. Using AB as the radius, draw an arc centered at **A**.
3. Using AB as the radius, draw an arc centered at **B** so it crosses the first arc at **C**.
4. Connect **A-C** and **B-C**. Triangle **ABC** has all sides equal, and angles of **60°**.

If you cannot draw arcs cleanly, you can “step” the same stick length around: AB is the length, then mark C by finding a point that is one AB length from both A and B.

### 45°: bisect a 90° angle

1. Make a 90° angle using the 3-4-5 method.
2. Mark the angle corner point **A** and draw a short arc that crosses both legs of the angle at points **D** and **E**.
3. From D, draw a small arc.
4. From E, draw a small arc with the same radius so the arcs intersect at **F**.
5. Draw line **A-F**. This line splits the right angle into **45°** and **45°**.

### 30° and 15°: bisect 60° (and then bisect again)

1. Build a 60° angle using the equilateral triangle method.
2. Use the same bisection steps above to split 60° into **30°**.
3. Bisect 30° to get **15°**.

## Using degrees in early articles (recommended style)

- Prefer descriptions like **“shallow / moderate / steep”** and “between 45° and 60°”.
- If you include degrees, add a reference like: “(about 60°; see [Measure Angles Without Tools](/articles/measure-angles-without-tools)).”

## Verification

- 3-4-5 triangle: if your measured BC equals 5 units, the angle at A is a right angle.
- Equilateral triangle: if AB, BC, and CA match, all angles are 60°.
- Bisection: the bisector should look symmetric; if you mark equal distances along both legs, the bisector should land in the middle.

## Safety

- Scratching lines with sharp stone edges can cut. Keep fingers behind edges and cut away from your body.
- Avoid marking angles on unstable ground where you can slip.

## Troubleshooting

- **My “right angle” looks off**: your length units drifted. Re-measure and make the triangle larger (errors matter less when the triangle is big).
- **Arcs don’t intersect cleanly**: your radius changed. Use a fixed stick length and keep the pivot point stable.
- **Lines are messy**: scratch lightly first, then deepen once you are confident.

## Variants

- Make an **angle template board**: scratch a 90° corner and a 60° corner into a flat board or plank so you can reuse it later.
