## Summary

A **gorge hook** is one of the simplest early fishing hooks: it is a small straight piece of bone or hard wood tied at the middle. Bait covers the gorge. When a fish swallows it and you pull the line, the gorge turns sideways and catches.

This article covers making a gorge hook, attaching it to a handline, and basic ways to fish with it.

## Prerequisites

- Cordage for line: [Make Cordage (Plant Fibers)](/articles/make-cordage-plant-fibers)
- A sharp cutting edge for shaping: [Make a Stone Flake Cutting Edge](/articles/make-stone-flake-cutting-edge)

## Diagram

## Materials

- Cordage line: several arm-lengths (longer line is easier in deeper water)
- Gorge material (choose one):
  - **Bone** (dense, not crumbly), or
  - **Hard wood** (dense, fine-grained), or
  - A strong **thorn** (small fish)
- Bait (worms, insects, small meat, fish scraps)
- Optional: small stone sinker, simple float (bark/wood)

## Steps

### 1) Make the gorge

1. Cut a straight piece about finger-length.
2. Smooth sharp corners so it does not cut your lashing.
3. Cut a small notch near each end (not deep; just enough to keep the lashing from slipping).

If using wood: choose a straight-grained piece and avoid punky or cracked wood.

### 2) Tie the line to the middle

Goal: the line must not slip off-center.

1. Lay the line across the middle of the gorge.
2. Wrap tightly around the gorge 8 to 12 turns.
3. Finish with two locking half-hitches around the standing part of the line (or tie off by tucking the end under the last wraps and pulling tight).
4. Pull hard to test: the lashing should not slide.

### 3) Add optional sinker and float

**Sinker (stone):**

1. Pick a small smooth stone.
2. Lash it 1 to 2 handspans above the gorge (wrap + jam the line into a shallow groove if you can scrape one).

**Float (bark/wood):**

1. Lash a small buoyant piece of bark/wood to the line above the sinker.

You can fish without either: a sinker helps get bait down; a float helps detect bites.

### 4) Bait the gorge

1. Wrap bait so it covers the gorge and hides the line tie.
2. Do not leave the gorge exposed; the goal is for the fish to swallow it.

### 5) Fish with the handline

Pick a low-risk spot (avoid fast current and deep water).

1. Lower or cast the baited gorge into water.
2. Keep light tension and watch for repeated tugs or a steady pull.
3. When you feel a solid pull, lift firmly and keep tension (do not jerk wildly).
4. Guide the fish to shore or shallow water.

Method options:

- **Still water**: fish near cover (rocks, submerged branches, edges).
- **Moving water**: fish behind rocks and in slower eddies.
- **Set line** (higher risk of loss): tie the free end to a branch and check often.

## Verification

- Lashing holds a hard pull without slipping.
- Gorge survives wetting and pulling without snapping.
- Bait stays on during gentle test dips.

## Safety

- Water is dangerous: avoid slippery rocks, do not wade into strong currents, and do not fish alone if you can avoid it.
- Hooks are sharp: keep away from eyes and do not wrap line tightly around fingers.
- Food safety: raw fish can carry parasites and pathogens. If possible, cook fish thoroughly (see [Make Fire (Hand Drill)](/articles/make-fire-hand-drill)).

## Troubleshooting

- **Fish take bait but you catch nothing**: the gorge may be too long/thick for the fish size; make a smaller gorge and use smaller bait.
- **Lashing slips**: deepen end notches slightly and add more wraps; use drier/tougher cordage.
- **Line breaks**: cordage is too weak or damaged; make thicker line or switch fiber source.
- **Bait falls off**: wrap bait with a thin fiber tie, or use stickier bait.

## Variants

- **Improvised hook**: a bent thorn or carved wooden hook can work, but gorges are simpler at low tech.
- **Simple spear**: sharpened stick fishing works in shallow clear water.
- **Trap/weir**: in some locations, passive fish traps are more efficient than hook-and-line.
