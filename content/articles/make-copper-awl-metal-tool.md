## Summary

This is a first practical metal tool: a copper awl. You consolidate copper prills into a small billet, then forge and anneal it into a tapered point. The awl can pierce leather, bark, and thin wood, and it becomes a gateway tool for more precise fabrication.

## Prerequisites

- Copper source: [Smelt Copper Prills (Small Batch)](/articles/smelt-copper-prills)
- Fire source: [Make Fire (Hand Drill)](/articles/make-fire-hand-drill)
- Optional binding/hafting: [Make Cordage (Plant Fibers)](/articles/make-cordage-plant-fibers)

## Materials

- Copper prills (enough to make a finger-length tool blank)
- Charcoal fire
- Flat anvil stone
- Hammerstone
- Optional wooden handle and cordage

## Steps

### 1) Consolidate prills into a billet

1. Heat a pile of copper prills in a concentrated charcoal zone.
2. When hot, move them onto a flat anvil stone.
3. Hammer firmly to weld/compact into a single lump.
4. Repeat heat-and-hammer cycles until you have one cohesive billet.

If the billet starts cracking while hammering, anneal again (next step).

### 2) Anneal often

1. Heat copper until dull red in low light.
2. Remove and let cool (air cool is fine).
3. Resume hammering.

Copper work-hardens quickly; frequent annealing prevents cracking.

### 3) Forge the point

1. Hammer one end into a tapered cone.
2. Rotate while hammering to keep the point centered.
3. Keep the opposite end thicker for grip or hafting.

Target shape:

- Tip: sharp but not needle-fragile
- Body: straight and gradually tapering

### 4) Straighten and finish

1. Lightly hammer along the shaft on a flat stone to straighten.
2. Work-harden only the tip with gentle cold hammering for extra stiffness.
3. Polish/smooth by rubbing with fine stone or sand.

### 5) Optional handle

1. Split a small stick.
2. Seat the thick end of awl in the split.
3. Lash tightly with cordage.

## Verification

- Awl tip can pierce leather/bark with controlled hand pressure.
- Tool remains straight after repeated use.
- Tip does not chip or crumble under normal piercing loads.

## Safety

- Hot copper looks similar to cold copper in bright light; treat all recently heated metal as hot.
- Hammer strikes can eject metal fragments; keep bystanders clear.
- Do not hold tiny hot pieces with bare fingers.

## Troubleshooting

- **Billet won’t consolidate**: prills may be oxidized/dirty; reheat hotter and hammer sooner after heating.
- **Cracks appear while forging**: anneal more frequently.
- **Tip bends too easily**: cold-work the final tip more, or make tip slightly thicker.
- **Tip breaks**: over-worked or too sharp; re-anneal and reforge with a sturdier taper.

## Variants

- **Scribe**: longer, finer tip for marking wood/clay.
- **Punch**: shorter, stouter tip for heavier piercing.
- **Mini chisel**: flatten tip instead of sharpening to a point.
