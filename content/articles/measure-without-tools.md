## Summary

Before you have rulers, you can still build reproducibly by using *your* body as a consistent measuring system. Your “units” will differ from other people’s, but they will be repeatable for you if you stay consistent.

This article defines a small set of body-based units and a simple way to make a durable reference so you can repeat dimensions across projects.

## Prerequisites

- None (Level 0).

## Units (choose a set and stick to it)

Pick a small set you will use everywhere:

- **Finger width**: width of your index finger (useful for small thicknesses).
- **Thumb width**: width of your thumb (useful for “thumb-thick” sticks).
- **Palm width**: width of your palm at the knuckles (good for small boards and bundles).
- **Handspan**: tip of thumb to tip of pinky with fingers spread.
- **Cubit**: elbow to fingertips (good for stick lengths and spacing).
- **Pace**: one normal step (good for distances and layouts).

Rule: avoid mixing units casually. If you write “arm-length” in one place, use “arm-length” again, not centimeters.

## Steps

### 1) Make a reference stick (optional but recommended)

This is a simple way to repeat measurements across days and across tasks.

1. Find a straight, dry stick roughly forearm-length.
2. Choose one end as the “zero” end.
3. Mark handspans and palm-widths by notching or scratching the stick.
4. Mark smaller units (finger widths) near one end for convenience.

If you have no cutting tool, you can scratch marks with a sharp stone edge, a hard pointed pebble, or by rubbing gritty sand into the wood with pressure.

### 2) Use “counted units” in your notes

When you write instructions, write them like:

- “Spindle: **4 handspans** long, **thumb-thick**.”
- “Notch opening: **2 finger widths** wide at the outer edge.”

If you want to help modern readers too, you can add metric in parentheses, but keep the *primary* instruction body-based.

## Verification

- Measure the same object three times on different days: you should get the same count of units each time.
- Two people using the same *reference stick* should get the same result.

## Safety

- If you scratch/notch sticks with sharp stone edges, treat them as knives: cut away from your body and keep fingers behind the edge.

## Troubleshooting

- **My measurements drift**: you are changing where you place your fingers/hand. Always start from the same “zero” end and use the same posture.
- **Reference marks wear off**: deepen the scratches, choose harder wood, or make multiple reference sticks.

## Variants

- **Cord reference**: once you can make cordage, tie knots every palm-width and use the cord as a flexible measuring tape.
