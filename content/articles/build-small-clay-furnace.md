## Summary

A small clay furnace concentrates heat and airflow so charcoal can reach temperatures suitable for early metallurgy. This version is a simple shaft furnace made from clay, sand, and fiber temper, with a clay air tube (tuyere).

## Prerequisites

- Fire source: [Make Fire (Hand Drill)](/articles/make-fire-hand-drill)
- Body-unit sizing: [Measure Without Tools (Body Units)](/articles/measure-without-tools)
- Angle references (for tuyere angle): [Measure Angles Without Tools (Degrees)](/articles/measure-angles-without-tools)

## Materials

- Clay-rich soil
- Sand or crushed fired-clay grog (to reduce cracking)
- Chopped dry grass or straw (fiber temper)
- Water
- Flat stones for base
- Charcoal (for drying/firing cycles)

## Steps

### 1) Mix furnace clay body

1. Start with roughly 2 parts clay-rich soil and 1 part sand/grog.
2. Add chopped dry fiber (small handfuls) until mix is tough and not sticky-sloppy.
3. Add water gradually and knead until uniform.

Test a fist-sized ball:

- If it cracks badly while drying, add more sand/grog.
- If it crumbles, add more clay/water.

### 2) Build a stable base

1. Choose bare ground sheltered from strong wind.
2. Lay flat stones or compacted clay as a base.
3. Form a short ring wall as the first course.

### 3) Build the shaft

1. Build a cylindrical shaft about knee-high to mid-thigh-high.
2. Keep the internal bore about 1 to 2 handspans wide.
3. Wall thickness: about a thumb to two fingers.

Smooth inside walls to reduce turbulence and weak points.

### 4) Add tuyere port and tuyere tube

1. Make an inlet hole near the lower side wall, just above base level.
2. Angle it slightly downward into the furnace (about 10° to 20° downward from horizontal).
3. Form a clay tuyere tube and seat it in this hole.

The downward angle helps focus heat near the reaction zone and reduces backflow.

### 5) Dry slowly

1. Air-dry until leather-hard (surface no longer soft).
2. Start a tiny warming fire inside to drive off moisture.
3. Increase to several small drying fires over hours.

Do not full-fire while wet, or the furnace may steam-crack.

### 6) Pre-fire before production use

1. Run a stronger charcoal fire for 1 to 2 hours.
2. Observe and patch cracks with fresh clay mix as needed.
3. Let cool; re-patch and dry if large cracks appear.

## Verification

- Furnace stands without slumping.
- Tuyere remains fixed and open.
- Walls survive repeated heating without major collapse.
- Charcoal can maintain a bright, concentrated hot zone near tuyere level.

## Safety

- Hot clay and stones can spall; keep face and eyes back from openings.
- Fumes and carbon monoxide are hazardous; operate outdoors with airflow.
- Keep water and soil nearby for fire control.

## Troubleshooting

- **Wall cracks everywhere**: too much clay/not enough temper; remix and patch with more sand/grog.
- **Tuyere clogs**: angle or opening too small; enlarge and keep clean with a stick while hot.
- **Weak heat**: furnace too wide, not enough charcoal, or insufficient airflow.

## Variants

- **Pit furnace**: below-grade bowl with side tuyere (simpler, usually lower output).
- **Two-tuyere furnace**: better heat distribution, more complex airflow control.
