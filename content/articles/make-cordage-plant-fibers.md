## Summary

Cordage (string/rope) is a force-multiplier: it enables binding, carrying, traps, fishing lines, bows, shelters, and many other tools. You can make usable cordage at Level 0 by processing natural fibers and twisting them into a 2‑ply reverse-wrap.

## Prerequisites

- None (Level 0).

## Materials

- **Fiber source**: long, tough plant fibers. Options include:
  - Inner bark (bast) from some trees/shrubs
  - Fibrous stems (nettles, dogbane, milkweed relatives)
  - Long grasses or reeds (usually weaker, but usable)
- Clean water (optional but helpful for soaking/softening fibers)

You do not need a cutting tool if you can tear/split fibers by hand, but a sharp stone edge makes it easier.

## Steps

### 1) Harvest and sort fibers

1. Collect a bundle of long fibers (longer is easier to twist).
2. Remove leaves, pith, and brittle outer layers.
3. Sort: keep the longest fibers for the main line, shorter fibers for splicing.

Goal: fibers that bend without snapping when you pull them gently.

### 2) Dry or dampen (depending on the fiber)

- Some fibers twist best **slightly damp** (less brittle).
- Some bark fibers need **soaking** to separate and soften.

If fibers snap while twisting, dampen them. If they stretch and get mushy, dry them a bit.

### 3) Make a 2‑ply reverse-wrap

This is the core technique: twist each strand in one direction, then wrap the two strands around each other in the opposite direction. The opposing twists lock.

1. Split your fiber bundle into two equal strands.
2. Twist the **right** strand away from you until it wants to kink.
3. Hold that twist, then wrap the **right** strand over the left strand (toward you).
4. Repeat: twist the new right strand away from you, then wrap it over.

Keep steady tension so the cord stays even.

### 4) Splice in new fiber (to make a long line)

1. Before a strand runs out, lay a new bundle of fibers overlapping the thinning strand by a palm-width or more.
2. Twist the old + new fibers together as if they were one strand.
3. Continue reverse-wrapping.

Stagger splices so both strands do not get thick at the same spot.

### 5) Finish and test

1. When you reach the desired length, tie a simple overhand knot to prevent untwisting.
2. Pull hard along the length to set the twist.
3. If it loosens, add more twist and keep tighter tension while wrapping.

## Verification

- **Evenness**: the cord thickness is fairly consistent.
- **Strength**: a short sample should hold your body weight when you pull on it with both hands (do not wrap around fingers).
- **Twist lock**: if you relax tension briefly, it does not immediately unravel.

## Safety

- Cordage under tension can cut skin. Do not wrap it tightly around fingers.
- Some plants irritate skin. If you get stinging/burning, switch fiber sources or use a barrier (bark wrap, cloth).

## Troubleshooting

- **Cord unravels**: you are not reverse-wrapping consistently; twist each strand until it wants to kink, then wrap.
- **Cord breaks at splices**: overlap is too short or fibers are too dry; increase overlap and dampen slightly.
- **Cord is lumpy**: splices are stacked; stagger them and keep strand sizes even.

## Variants

- **3‑ply rope**: make three cords and braid them, or reverse-wrap three strands (harder but stronger).
- **Flat braid**: good for straps; weaker as a round line.
