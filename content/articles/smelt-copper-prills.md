## Summary

This article describes a practical first smelt: producing small metallic copper droplets (“prills”) from ore. You then recover and consolidate these prills into a workable metal piece.

## Prerequisites

- Charcoal fuel: [Make Charcoal Fuel (Pit Method)](/articles/make-charcoal-fuel)
- Furnace: [Build a Small Clay Furnace (With Tuyere)](/articles/build-small-clay-furnace)
- Ore selection: [Find and Test Copper Ore (Field Method)](/articles/find-and-test-copper-ore)

## Materials

- Tested copper ore (crushed)
- Charcoal (lump + fine)
- Small amount of silica-rich sand or ash (optional flux)
- Clay furnace with working tuyere
- Hammerstone and flat stone for breaking slag and recovering prills

## Steps

### 1) Prepare ore

1. Crush ore to coarse sand / small grit.
2. Remove obvious waste rock and dirt.
3. Optional: roast ore in an open charcoal fire until dry and brittle.

Roasting often improves reduction behavior and makes ore easier to crush.

### 2) Heat furnace to operating temperature

1. Fill lower furnace with charcoal.
2. Start fire and build a bright hot zone near tuyere level.
3. Run airflow until charcoal bed is fully established.

### 3) Charge ore and charcoal in layers

1. Add a thin ore layer.
2. Cover with charcoal.
3. Repeat small layers, keeping top mostly charcoal.

Do not smother the furnace with too much ore at once.

### 4) Maintain hot reducing conditions

1. Keep strong heat and steady airflow.
2. Refill charcoal as it drops.
3. Continue 1 to 3 hours depending on furnace size and charge amount.

You want sustained bright heat, not intermittent flare-ups.

### 5) Recover prills

1. Let furnace cool to safe handling temperature.
2. Remove slaggy masses from the reaction zone.
3. Break slag on a flat stone.
4. Pick out metallic copper prills/droplets.

Repeat batches to accumulate enough copper for a tool blank.

## Verification

- Prills are metallic copper color (often reddish to orange-brown after cleaning).
- Prills flatten under hammering instead of shattering.
- Collected prills can be consolidated by reheating and hammering.

## Safety

- Smelting fumes can be hazardous. Work outdoors, upwind, and avoid inhaling smoke/dust.
- Never add wet ore/charcoal into very hot furnace zones; steam and spall can eject hot material.
- Heat-retaining slag stays dangerous for a long time.

## Troubleshooting

- **No metal recovered**: ore may be low grade, furnace too cool, or atmosphere too oxidizing.
- **Prills are very tiny and scarce**: crush ore finer, run longer, use stronger airflow.
- **Too much glassy slag**: reduce flux/additives, adjust ore-to-charcoal ratio, avoid overfeeding gangue-rich ore.

## Variants

- **Multiple re-smelts**: re-smelt slag and low-grade residues to recover additional copper.
- **Bowl furnace method**: lower throughput but simpler construction.
